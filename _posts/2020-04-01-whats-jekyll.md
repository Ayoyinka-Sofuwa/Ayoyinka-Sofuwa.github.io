title: Found an exciting all-in-one EDA tool.
---

It is popularly said that 80% of a data scientist's time is spent on EDA, looking for a simple way to do your basic EDA in one or two lines of code?


[Pandas-profiling](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-profiling/) is a tool for creating profile reports from a pandas dataframe. It's really useful for some quick data analysis. 

Here's what I did with it. I worked on this dataset from [JovianML](https://twitter.com/jovianml) which you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JovianML/opendatasets/master/data/medical-charges.csv)

 From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.
